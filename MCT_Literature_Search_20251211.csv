The initial search identified 2482 records; 26 papers remained once duplicates were removed and inclusion criteria were applied. Studies (<i>n</i> = 27) in the analyses were randomized crossover designs comparing the effects of two or more eating events on DIT. Higher energy intake increased DIT; in a mixed model meta-regression, for every 100 kJ increase in energy intake, DIT increased by 1.1 kJ/h (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Meals with a high protein or carbohydrate content had a higher DIT than high fat, although this effect was not always significant. Meals with medium chain triglycerides had a significantly higher DIT than long chain triglycerides (meta-analysis, <i>p</i> = 0.002). Consuming the same meal as a single bolus eating event compared to multiple small meals or snacks was associated with a significantly higher DIT (meta-analysis, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Unclear or inconsistent findings were found by comparing the consumption of meals quickly or slowly, and palatability was not significantly associated with DIT. These findings indicate that the magnitude of the increase in DIT is influenced by the energy intake, macronutrient composition, and eating pattern of the meal.","The Energy Content and Composition of Meals Consumed after an Overnight Fast and Their Effects on Diet Induced Thermogenesis: A Systematic Review, Meta-Analyses and Meta-Regressions.",27792142

MCT also differ from LCT in their digestive and metabolic pathways. To test the effects of MCT supplementation during a very low calorie diet (VLCD). Three groups of tightly matched obese women with body mass index (BMI)>30 kg/m(2) received an isoenergetic (578.5 kcal) VLCD (Adinax, Novo Vital, Sweden) enriched with MCT or LCT (8.0 and 9.9 g/100 g Adinax respectively) or a low-fat (3 g/100 g) and high-carbohydrate regimen. The diets were administered over 4 weeks. Body composition was measured with DEXA and appetite/satiety-according to Blundell. Beta hydroxybutyric acid concentration in plasma and nitrogen excretion in urine was measured during consecutive days of VLCD. The study was performed in a randomised double-blind manner. The MCT group showed a significantly greater decrease in body weight during the first 2 weeks. The contribution of body fat to the total weight loss was higher while the contribution of fat-free mass (FFM) was lower. The MCT group had a higher concentration of ketone bodies in plasma and a lower nitrogen excretion in urine. Hunger feelings were less intense while satiety was higher. These differences were observed during the first 2 weeks of treatment and gradually declined during the third and fourth weeks. Replacement of LCT by MCT in the VLCD increased the rate of decrease of body fat and body weight and has a sparing effect on FFM. The intensity of hunger feelings was lower and paralleled the higher increase of ketone bodies. These effects gradually declined, indicating subsequent metabolic adaptation. Further studies are required to confirm the protein-sparing and appetite-suppressing effects of MCT supplementation during the first 2 weeks of VLCD treatment.",Value of VLCD supplementation with medium chain triglycerides.,11571605

Preliminary evidence from studies of medium (MCT) and long chain triglycerides (LCT) supports greater appetite suppression on high-MCT diets, possibly a consequence of direct portal access, more rapid oxidation and muted lipaemia. No data is as yet available on high-SCT diets which also have direct hepatic access. In this study SCT- (dairy fats), MCT- (coconut oil) and LCT-enriched (beef tallow) test breakfasts (3.3 MJ) containing 52 g lipid (58 en% fat) were investigated in a randomized, cross-over study in 18 lean men. All participants were required to complete the 3 study days in randomised order. Participants rated appetite sensations using visual analogue scales (VAS), and energy intake (EI) was measured by covert weighing of an ad libitum lunch meal 3.5 h postprandially. Blood samples were collected by venous cannulation. There were no detectable differences between breakfasts in perceived pleasantness, visual appearance, smell, taste, aftertaste and palatability (P>0.05). There was no significant effect of fatty acid chain length on ratings of hunger, fullness, satisfaction or current thoughts of food, nor did energy (mean, sem: SCT: 4406, 366 kJ; MCT: 4422, 306 kJ; LCT: 4490, 324 kJ; P>0.05) or macronutrient intake at lunch differ between diets. The maximum difference in EI between diets was less than 2%. Postprandial lipaemia also did not differ significantly. We conclude that there was no evidence that fatty acid chain length has an effect on measures of appetite and food intake when assessed following a single high-fat test meal in lean participants.","Fatty acid chain length, postprandial satiety and food intake in lean men.",20451538

Experts therefore advise avoidance of catabolic situations and discourage weight reduction in these patients.Two patients with late-diagnosed LCFAOD undergoing treatment at two academic centers successfully lost weight under supervision of a metabolic dietitian. Patient 1 (male, 47 years) diagnosed with CPT 2 deficiency lost 10 kg body weight in a 3-month period with the help of an energy and LCT-restricted, MCT- and carbohydrate-rich diet in combination with an exercise program. CK levels, C16, C18, and C18:1 levels of his acylcarnitine profile and his blood pressure decreased during the period of weight reduction. Patient 2 (male, 39 years) has a VLCAD deficiency. Dietary advice was energy and LCT restriction, MCT and carbohydrate-enriched food with raw cornstarch added during the night. Patient 2 lost almost 40 kg body weight to 87.6 kg (BMI 25.1) in 2 years. CK, insulin, TG, and ALAT blood levels decreased. Weight reduction without loss of metabolic control seems possible in late-onset LCFAOD patients. No metabolic crisis occurred in these two patients, while the positive effects of weight reduction were clear. The residual enzyme function in late-onset LCFAOD may be one of the reasons that metabolic decompensation was prevented. In addition, dietary adjustments to prevent excessive fatty acid oxidation likely contributed as well. Therefore, expert supervision by a dietician specialized in metabolic diseases is recommended.

The study comprised 53 females with a mean age of 44.5 years (range 29–65 years, standard deviation 9.42 years, median 44 years), who completed a controlled weight loss programme. At the beginning and at the end of the programme, anthropometric parameters (Body Mass Index (BMI), weight and waist circumference) were measured and the posturography tests Limits of Stability (LOS) and Motor Control Test (MCT) were performed using the NeuroCom's SMART EquiTest system. The data were statistically analyzed using R software at a level of significance of 0.05. There were positive changes after the controlled weight loss programme in anthropometric parameters (BMI reduction, with p<0.001; waist circumference reduction, with p<0.001; and weight loss, with p<0.001), postural stability with statistically significant (p<0.05) improvements in both postural activity (LOS test parameters) and reactions (MCT parameters). The study showed a statistically significant effect of comprehensive group therapy for obesity in terms of reductions in waist circumference, body weight and BMI, and thus the overall reduction of both cardiovascular and metabolic risks, as well as improved postural skills (activity and reactions).",Comprehensive Group Therapy of Obesity and Its Impact on Selected Anthropometric and Postural Parameters.,29346858

Nine healthy male volunteers with BMI ≤25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were enrolled for this study and given balanced diets prepared with coconut oil (CO; ~35 g) for a period of eight weeks. After a wash-out period of six weeks, the same subjects were provided with diets prepared with peanut oil (~35 g) for eight weeks. Except fat source, the composition of the diets was identical in all aspects. Compared to basal values, there were significant increases in fat-free mass (p ≤ 0.022), plasma HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) (p ≤ 0.047) and insulin sensitivity of the subjects at the end of CO-consumption. Further, compared to peanut oil, increase in plasma HDL-C was significant (p = 0.004) in CO treatment. On the other hand, plasma inflammatory markers-associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), namely soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM1) and matrix metalloproteinase levels were reduced significantly by CO-intake. Further, these subjects displayed elevated levels of myristic acid (14:0) in plasma phospholipids at the end of CO-consumption, which correlated positively with HDL-C and negatively with sVCAM1. However, no such changes were observed after peanut oil diet consumption. In conclusion, compared to peanut oil, the consumption of coconut oil in a balanced diet resulted in increased fat-free mass, plasma HDL-C, elicited favourable changes on insulin sensitivity and CVD risk-associated parameters in healthy men with normal BMI.","Coconut oil consumption improves fat-free mass, plasma HDL-cholesterol and insulin sensitivity in healthy men with normal BMI compared to peanut oil.",30630708

Exposure early-in-life to increased MCFA levels might affect development and impact (lipid) metabolism later in life. We tested whether an increased MCFA intake early-in-life positively affects adult body composition and metabolic status when challenged by a western-style diet (WSD). Male offspring of C57Bl/6j mice and Wistar rats were fed a control diet (CTRL; 10 w% fat, 14% MCFA) or a medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) diet with 20% MCFA until postnatal (PN) day 42, whereupon animals were fed a WSD (10 w% fat) until PN day 98. Body composition was monitored by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA). In rats, glucose homeostasis was assessed by glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT); in mice, the HOmeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated. At autopsy on PN day 98, plasma lipid profiles, glucose, insulin, and adipokines were measured; organs and fat pads were collected and the adipocyte size distribution was analysed. Milk analysis in mice showed that the maternal MCT diet was not translated into milk, and pups were thus only exposed to high MCT levels from early weaning onward: PN day 16 until 42. Mice exposed to MCT showed 28% less fat accumulation vs. CTRL during WSD. The average adipocyte cell size, fasting plasma triglycerides (TG), and leptin levels were reduced in MCT mice. In rats, no effects were found on the adult body composition, but the adipocyte cell size distribution shifted towards smaller adipocytes. Particularly mice showed positive effects on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.

Ten obese subjects underwent non-macronutrient-specific energy restriction for 15 wk. Anthropometric measurements and a needle biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle before and after the weight loss program were performed. Enzymatic activity, fiber type distribution, and skeletal muscle MCT protein expression were measured. Muscle from nonobese control subjects was used for comparison of MCT levels. The program induced a weight loss of 9.2 +/- 1.6 kg. Compared with controls, muscle from obese subjects showed a strong tendency (P = 0.06) for elevated MCT4 expression (+69%) before the weight loss program. MCT4 expression decreased (-7%) following weight loss to reach levels that were not statistically different from control levels. There were no differences in MCT1 expression between controls and obese subjects before and after weight loss. A highly predictive regression model (R2 = 0.93), including waist circumference, citrate synthase activity, and percentage of type 1 fibers, was found to explain the highly variable MCT1 response to weight loss in the obese group. Therefore, in obesity, MCT1 expression appears linked both to changes in oxidative parameters and to changes in visceral adipose tissue content. The strong tendency for elevated expression of muscle MCT4 could reflect the need to release greater amounts of muscle lactate in the obese state, a situation that would be normalized with weight loss as indicated by decreased MCT4 levels.",Effect of weight loss on lactate transporter expression in skeletal muscle of obese subjects.,18079261

A total of 19 healthy overweight men aged (x+/-s.e.m.) 44.5+/-2.5 y with a body mass index of 27.8+/-0.5 kg/m(2). EE and body composition were measured using indirect calorimetry and magnetic resonance imaging, respectively, at the baseline and end point of each feeding period. EE was measured for 30 min before consumption of a standard meal and for 5.5 h following the meal. Body weight (BW) decreased (P<0.05) by 1.03+/-0.25 kg with MCT consumption compared to 0.62+/-0.29 kg with LCT consumption. The difference in average EE between MCT and LCT consumptions was related to initial BW, such that men with lower initial BW had a greater rise in EE with MCT consumption relative to LCT on day 28 (r=-0.472, P=0.04) but not day 2 (r=-0.368, P=0.12). Similar results were obtained with fat oxidation on day 28 (r=-0.553, P=0.01). The greater rise in fat oxidation with MCT compared to LCT consumption on day 2 tended to be related to greater loss of BW after MCT vs LCT consumption (r=-0.4075, P=0.08). These data suggest that shunting of dietary fat towards oxidation results in diminished fat storage, as reflected by the loss of BW and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Furthermore, MCT consumption may stimulate EE and fat oxidation to a lower extent in men of greater BW compared to men of lower BW, indicative of the lower responsiveness to a rapidly oxidized fat by overweight men.International",Greater rise in fat oxidation with medium-chain triglyceride consumption relative to long-chain triglyceride is associated with lower initial body weight and greater loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue.,12975635

Forty-nine overweight men and women, aged 19-50 y, consumed either 18-24 g/d of MCT oil or olive oil as part of a weight-loss program for 16 wk. Subjects received weekly group weight-loss counseling. Body weight and waist circumference were measured weekly. Adipose tissue distribution was assessed at baseline and at the endpoint by use of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography. Thirty-one subjects completed the study (body mass index: 29.8 +/- 0.4, in kg/m(2)).

MCT consumption will not result in greater EE, substrate oxidation, and body weight loss compared with LCT consumption. Seventeen healthy obese women participated in this randomized, crossover inpatient trial. Meals were prepared and consumed on site for two periods of 27 days. Diets containing 40% of energy as fat, with treatment fat comprising 75% of the total fat, were designed to supply each subject with their individual weight-maintaining energy needs. The MCT diet contained 67% of treatment fat as MCT oil (49% octanoate, 50% decanoate) whereas the LCT diet contained exclusively beef tallow as treatment fat. Body composition was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on day 1 and 28 of each phase while energy expenditure was measured on day 2 and 27. Changes in total and subcutaneous adipose tissue volumes following consumption of MCT and LCT were not different (-0.61+/-0.38 l vs -0.54+/-0.48 l and -0.58+/-0.35 l vs -0.48+/-0.40 l, respectively).

These results show that long-term consumption of MCT enhances EE and fat oxidation in obese women, when compared to LCT consumption. The difference in body composition change between MCT and LCT consumption, although not statistically different, was consistent with differences predicted by the shifts in EE.

Twenty-four healthy overweight men (body mass index 28.2 +/- 0.4 kg/m(2)) consumed controlled diets designed to maintain weight for two periods of 29 d each. Diets contained 40% of energy as fat, 75% of which was added fat, either FctO or olive oil (OL). Body composition and blood samples were analyzed at the baseline and the endpoint of each period. Total cholesterol concentration decreased 12.5% (-0.68 mmol/L; P < 0.05) when subjects consumed FctO and 4.7% when they consumed OL. Similarly, FctO consumption lowered LDL cholesterol concentrations by 13.9%, whereas OL consumption did not. There was no difference in absolute change in LDL-cholesterol between FctO and OL consumption. Peak LDL particle size was greater in those who consumed FctO than in those who consumed OL (P < 0.05), with no effect of diet on proportion of large, medium or small particles. We conclude that those who consume a diet containing FctO have a better lipid profile than those who consume a diet rich in OL, which also leads to a larger lipoprotein particle size.

Labeled triacylglycerol and indirect calorimetry were used. Results showed that LCTs were less oxidized in obese than in control subjects (3.2+/-0.5 compared with 6.0+/-0.4 g, P < 0.01). Moreover, the amount of LCT oxidized was negatively correlated with fat mass (r = -0.77, P < 0.01). Appearance in plasma of dietary triacyglycerol-derived long-chain fatty acids was blunted in obese subjects and it was negatively related to fat mass (r = -0.84, P < 0.01) and positively to LCT oxidation (r = 0.70, P < 0.01).

The objective of the trial was to test whether addition of oils containing triacylglycerols with medium-chain fatty acid can prevent this decline and whether their administration can affect the lipid spectrum. Sixty obese patients were served for a four-week period of hospitalization at the obesitology unit a low-energy diet REDITA (Promil Co., N. Bydzov) providing 1596 kJ, 37 g protein, 50 g carbohydrate and 3 g fat. Part of the treatment was regular aerobic exercise, behavioural therapy to teach correct dietary habits and physical activity; physical activity was monitored by means of pedometers. From this group during the 3rd and 4th week 11 patients with similar characteristics were separated (age, body weight, BMI and energy expenditure at rest) as in the basic group. These patients were given daily 15 ml oil containing triacylglycerols with medium-chain fatty acids, MCT OIL (Mead Johnson, Evansville), providing 545 kJ. The resting energy expenditure was assessed in all patients every morning on fasting, immediately after awakening, using indirect calorimetry and it was corrected with regard to the respiratory quotient and excretion of catabolic nitrogen. The body composition was assessed at the beginning and at the end of the trial by hydrostatic weighing. Administration of oil containing triacylglycerols with medium-chain fatty acids (MCT OIL) prevented the decline of the resting energy expenditure (130.0 +/- 9.2 kJ/kg lean body mass/day, as compared with 126.5 +/- 7.2 kJ/kg lean body mass/day in the basic group: the difference is statistically not significant). Although addition of oil increased the energy intake by 545 kJ/day, the drop of body weight and BMI was comparable with that in the group of obese patients who did not receive the oil (10.3 +/- 1.1 kg vs. 10.6 +/- 0.5 kg). While during administration of the oil the resting energy expenditure did not change (5.97 +/- 0.30 kJ/min. vs. 5.24 +/- 0.58 kJ/min.), in obese patients who were only on the strict reducing diet it declined from 5.45 +/- 0.18 kJ/min. to 4.44 +/- 0.22 kJ/min. (p < 0.01). The significant drop of total cholesterol achieved by dietotherapy alone (5.41 +/- 0.21 mmol/l vs. 6.26 0.20 mmol/l before treatment) was not affected by administration of oil (4.86 +/- 0.28 mmol/l vs. 5.69 +/- 0.35 mmol/l before treatment). HDL-cholesterol, on the other hand, declined only in obese patients with dietotherapy (1.40 +/- 0.04 mmol/vs. 1.22 +/- 0.04 mmol/l after treatment, p < 0.01). The triacylglycerol values declined significantly in both groups (p < 0.01).
